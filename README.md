# fullstack_developer_capstone

Project Overview
This is the capstone project for the IBM Cloud Native Full Stack Development course on Coursera. It is a full-stack, cloud-native dealership management application that allows users to browse car dealerships, view reviews, and submit their own reviews with sentiment analysis.

The application consists of multiple interconnected services deployed using modern cloud-native practices, including Docker containers, Kubernetes orchestration, and IBM Cloud Code Engine.


Core Components:
Dealerships Website (Django Application) - Main web application with user interface

Django Proxy Services - Bridges between Django and external services

Car Database (SQLite) - Stores Car Make and Car Model data

Dealerships & Reviews Service (Express + MongoDB) - Manages dealer and review data in a Docker container

Sentiment Analyzer Service - Deployed on IBM Cloud Code Engine for sentiment analysis of reviews

Features
User Management: Django authentication system with React frontend

Dealership Browsing: View dealerships by state or individually

Review Management: Read and submit reviews for dealerships

Sentiment Analysis: Automatic sentiment detection for reviews (positive/negative/neutral)

Dynamic Pages: Django templates for interactive user experience

Cloud-Native Deployment: Containerized services with Kubernetes orchestration

CI/CD Pipeline: Automated linting and deployment processes
